## Description
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting on the menu to be devoured. Each burger on the menu also has a `Devour!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move under the `Devoured Burgers` section. The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

#### Objective
Create a burger logger with `MySQL`, `Node`, `Express`, `Handlebars` and a homemade `ORM` (yum!). The project follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
